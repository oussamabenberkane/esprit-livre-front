orders : 
 - add image cover for packs (first one) : 
    - correct endpoint call but no response for the image from the api ( /api/book-packs/{packId}/cover ) 
    - api response : 302 Found
    - sollution : The backend is redirecting to the homepage (/) instead of serving the image. This is a security/authentication issue. The Problem:
Your backend endpoint /api/book-packs/1/cover requires authentication
Since the image request doesn't include auth headers, it redirects to login/home
Status 302 with Location: http://localhost:8080/
Solution (Backend Fix Required): Your backend needs to make /api/book-packs/{id}/cover publicly accessible (no authentication required), just like book covers. Tell your backend developer:
Make the pack cover endpoint public (remove authentication requirement)
Similar to how /api/books/{id}/cover is likely already public
The endpoint should return the image with status 200 and Content-Type: image/jpeg
Alternative (Frontend Fix): If pack covers MUST be authenticated, you need to fetch them differently (using fetch() with auth headers and convert to blob URLs), but this is more complex and not recommended for images. Bottom line: Backend security configuration is blocking the image requests. The endpoint needs to be made public.


Specific redirection : done
 - when the user authenticates for the very first time > he is told that he has to add his phone number > updates the profile > check the response > if  "linkedOrdersCount" superior to 0 > redirect user to orders with a success msg saying orders linked succesfully to you current acocunt or something

update the current order confirmed popup: 
 - add some text to show the user when he can find his orders if already authenticated
