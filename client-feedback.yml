prompt : 

here is the prompt : 
I want to extend the existing “add book to cart” logic to support packs as well, using the exact same storage strategy and behavior already implemented for books (localStorage + CartContext state, persistence across pages, badge updates, i18n, confirmation popup, etc.).

Please implement full pack support in the cart system across all relevant components and services.

Requirements

Reuse the same add/remove/update logic currently used for books.

Packs should behave exactly like books in the cart:

Added whether user is authenticated or not

Persisted in localStorage

Count reflected in the floating cart badge

Confirmation popup (with i18n)

Appears correctly in CartCheckoutPage

Restores on reload

Triggers reappearance of the floating badge if it was manually removed

Files to check

@el-user-app/src/components/common/BookCard.jsx
(Add pack handling, similar to book handling)

@el-user-app/src/services/cart.service.js
(Add pack add/remove/get methods using same structure as books)

@el-user-app/src/pages/PacksPromotionnels.jsx
(Integrate “add pack to cart” UI + confirmation popup)

@el-user-app/src/services/bookPackService.js
(Ensure pack data is formatted consistently for cart entries)

@el-user-app/src/contexts/CartContext.jsx
(Add pack actions to global cart state, mirroring book logic)

@el-user-app/src/pages/CartCheckoutPage.jsx
(Display packs in the cart alongside books)

@el-user-app/src/components/common/cartConfirmationPopup.jsx
(Add i18n messages for packs)

@el-user-app/src/pages/AllBooks.jsx
(Enable “add pack to cart” in the packs recommendation section)

Behavior to Match

LocalStorage persistence

Automatic cart badge count update

Full i18n integration

Confirmation popup identical to books

Visibility restoration for floating badge

Proper cart rendering on checkout page

Click vs drag badge behavior remains intact

do not touch any add book to cart logic and implement a moder and simple ui for packs listing among the books in @el-user-app/src/pages/CartCheckoutPage.jsx  

ask questions before doing anything

here are the questions claude asked me : 
Questions Before Implementation
1. Cart Storage Structure
Currently, cart items are stored as {bookId, quantity, addedAt}. For packs, should we:
Option A: Store separately with {packId, quantity, addedAt} in a different localStorage key (e.g., el_cart_packs)?
Option B: Store in the same array with a type discriminator like {id, type: 'book'|'pack', quantity, addedAt}?
Option C: Store pack items as individual books that comprise the pack?
2. Pack Quantity Behavior
Can users add multiple quantities of the same pack (like books)?
Should packs have stock quantity limits like books do?
3. Pack Pricing in Cart
When a pack is in the cart:
Show only the pack price (discounted total)?
Show both original price (sum of books) and pack price with strikethrough?
How should this display in the cart summary calculations?
4. Pack Identification
Looking at the code, I see packs have:
pack.id - the pack identifier
pack.books[] - array of books in the pack
pack.price - pack price
pack.title - pack title
Should the cart item reference just the packId, or should it store the full pack details to avoid re-fetching?
5. Cart Checkout Page UI for Packs
You mentioned "modern and simple UI for packs listing among books". Should packs:
Option A: Appear as a single row showing the pack title with expandable book list?
Option B: Display as a card showing pack image + title + "Contains X books" with a hover/click to see details?
Option C: Show inline with a distinct visual treatment (different background color, icon, etc.)?
6. Pack Cover Image
I see getBookPackCoverUrl(pack.id) is used. In cart:
Show the pack's cover image if available?
Show the first book's cover as fallback?
Show a generic pack icon?
7. Pack Removal Confirmation
When removing a pack from cart:
Same confirmation popup as books?
Different message mentioning "This will remove all X books in this pack"?
8. Floating Cart Badge Count
Should the badge count:
Option A: Count packs as 1 item each (regardless of how many books inside)?
Option B: Count total books (so 1 pack with 3 books = +3 to count)?
Option C: Show separate indicators for books vs packs?
9. i18n Keys Location
Where should I add the new translation keys for packs? I see translations are used like t('cartPopup.title'). Should I add:
packPopup.title, packPopup.added, etc. (separate namespace)?
Reuse cartPopup.* keys with dynamic content?
10. Pack Details Navigation
In CartConfirmationPopup, books have a "View Details" button going to /books/${id}. For packs:
Navigate to /packs/${id} (does this route exist)?
Show pack books popup instead?
No detail link for packs?
Please answer these questions so I can implement the solution exactly as you envision it! 🎯

here are my answers : 
1 - option A
2 - yes and yes
3 - Show only the pack price, count it by adding the new packs price
4 - just the pack id, and when the user clicks on a pack make the @el-user-app/src/components/common/PackBooksPopup.jsx appear 
5 - show them among the books with a siimilar ui 
6 - Show the first book's cover as fallback with a something on top of it that makes it clear that its a pack and not just a book
7 - Same confirmation popup as books
8 - count pack as 1 item
9 - follow the books implementation for i18n
10 - just make the @el-user-app/src/components/common/PackBooksPopup.jsx modal appear
